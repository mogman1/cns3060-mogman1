I actually found this project much simpler than the scheduling algorithms one.  While on the
other project I had to do a lot of things by hand to ferret out a bug I had, here everything
worked basically first try after following the directions.  So instead I played around with
the program, sending a few from the terminal to a running instance and hanging the program
more than a few times in the process.  Thank goodness for multiple cores...
